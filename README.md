# JokeBankApp
This is one of the first apps I created with the help of 
[The 10 Day iPhone App Bootcamp](https://learning.oreilly.com/videos/the-10-day/9781839218569/)
, a course taught on O'Reilly by Nick Walter. This app uses `UITableView` to hold the jokes. 

## How to Use
1. Open this file on XCode and either open the `Simulator` or connect your iPhone to your Mac so the app can be displayed there.

2. Click on any title to open a page with the Joke and the Answer.

3. Enjoy!
